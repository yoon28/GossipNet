2.  Licence.
    2.1. The Licensor has all copyright and rights in the nature of copyright
    subsisting in the Software. In addition, the Licensor has filed a patent
    application in Europe in connection with the Software. The Licensor grants
    the Licensee for the duration of this Agreement, a free of charge,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable copyright and patent licence (in consequence
    of said patent application) to use the Software for any non-commercial
    purpose only, including teaching and research at educational institutions,
    research at not-for-profit research institutions and for personal
    not-for-profit use, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
    Non-commercial use expressly excludes any profit-making or commercial
    activities, including without limitation sale, licence, manufacture or
    development of commercial products, use in commercially-sponsored research,
    provision of consulting service, use for or on behalf of any commercial
    entity, and use in research where a commercial party obtains rights to
    research results or any other benefit. Any use of the Software for any
    purpose other than non-commercial research shall automatically terminate
    this Licence.

    2.2 The Licensee is permitted to make modifications to the Software provided
    that distribution of such modifications is in accordance with Clause 3.

    2.3 Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement and save to the extent
    and in the circumstances expressly required to be permitted by law, the
    Licensee is not permitted to rent, lease, sell, offer to sell or loan the
    Software or its associated documentation.

3.  Redistribution and modifications.
    3.1 The Licensee may reproduce and distribute copies of the Software with or
    without modifications, in source format only and provided that any and every
    distribution is accompanied by an unmodified copy of this Licence and that
    the following copyright notice is always displayed in an obvious manner:
    Copyright © Max Planck Society. All rights reserved.

    3.2 In the case where the Software has been modified, any distribution must
    include prominent notices indicating which files have been changed.

    3.3 The Licensee shall cause any work that it distributes or publishes, that
    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Software or any part
    thereof (“Work based on the Software”), to be licensed as a whole at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this Licence.

    3.4 Each time the Licensee re-distributes the Software or any Work based on
    the Software, the recipient thereof (“Recipient”) automatically receives a
    licence from the Licensor to copy, use, distribute, or modify the Software
    subject to these terms and conditions. The Licensee may not impose any
    further restrictions on the Recipient’s exercise of the rights granted
    herein. The Licensee shall not be responsible for enforcing compliance by
    third parties to this Licence.


4.  Duration.
    This Agreement is effective until the Licensee terminates it by destroying
    the Software and its documentation together with all copies. It will also
    terminate automatically if the Licensee fails to abide by its terms. Upon
    automatic termination the Licensee agrees to destroy all copies of the
    Software and its documentation.


5.  Disclaimer of Warranties.
    The Software is provided as is. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
    Licensor provides no warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or
    implied, including without limitation, any warranties or condition of title,
    non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.


6.  Limitation of Liability
    In no event shall the Licensor and/or Authors be liable for any direct,
    indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages (including
    but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of
    use, data or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any
    theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
    (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of
    this Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.


7.  Indemnity.
    The Licensee or a Recipient (as the case may be) shall indemnify the
    Licensor and/or Authors against all third party claims that may be asserted
    against or suffered by the Licensor and/or Authors and which relate to use
    of the Software by the Licensee or the Recipient.


8.  Intellectual Property.
    8.1 Copyright and all other intellectual property rights subsisting in or in
    connection with the Software and supporting information shall remain at all
    times the property of the Licensor. The Licensee shall acquire no rights in
    any such material except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

    8.2 No permission is granted to use the trademarks or product names of the
    Licensor except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the origin of the Software and for the purposes of abiding by the terms of
    Clause 3.1.

    8.3 The Licensee or a Recipient (as applicable) shall promptly notify the
    Licensor, in sufficient detail, all improvements and new uses of the
    Software (“Improvements”). The Licensor and its affiliates shall have a
    non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual
    licence under the Improvements for non-commercial academic research and
    teaching purposes.

    8.4 The Licensee or a Recipient (as applicable) grants an exclusive first
    option to the Licensor to be exercised by the Licensor within three (3)
    years of the date of notification of the  Improvements under Clause 8.3 to
    use any Improvements for commercial purposes on terms to be negotiated and
    agreed by the parties in good faith within a period of six (6) months from
    the date of exercise of the said option (including without limitation any
    royalty share in net income from such commercialization payable to the
    Licensee or a Recipient, as the case may be).


9. Acknowledgements.
    The Licensee shall acknowledge the Authors and use of the Software in the
    publication of any work that uses, or results that are achieved through, the
